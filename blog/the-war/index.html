    <p>I think everyone knew that a crisis was about to hit, but no one was ready for an actual war, when we heard the first explosion we were shocked to our core, I mean you see it and hear it in the movies and while you are playing games but in real life, when you are in it, it&rsquo;s something else entirely
of course when it started, everyone was being optimistic that it&rsquo;ll all be over in a matter of hours, with no electricity, water or fuel it was almost like being captive.
one funny note was the realization that there isn&rsquo;t gonna be work tomorrow
after a week in the midest of this we found a way to leave the city, and me being stupidly optimistic thinking that it&rsquo;ll all be over in about two weeks, took only two sets of clothes leaving everything behind, which later we found that it was all raveged
I&rsquo;ve lost a lot, we all did, but.. getting back up is the only option I have, to help me and my family, that&rsquo;s why I moved to UAE to find a way for a new life, a better life.</p>
