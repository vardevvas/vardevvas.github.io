    <p>I do not exactly know if it was the recent uprise on the hype of tech or it&rsquo;s that I&rsquo;ve always been fasinated with tech
the latter part is a fact, I&rsquo;ve been following the fields of hardware and software and always felt a void stemed from the lack of knowledge in those fields
not utilizing the 5 year BS.c on Petroleum engineering felt like it is a waste so I&rsquo;ve tried to build a career on it, that was on 2015, one year later I knew that this career peak meant nothing to me, and on that same year I enrolled on the higher diploma in IT, thinking that it&rsquo;s the best option to get into that community
I completed that Diploma but as it turned out I did not utilize it at all and continued with my job on the petroleum field
having the passion to learn everything there is to know about the software and the hardware alike was in a way a disadvantage, because it made me scattered not knowing where and what to begin with.
but knowing that I&rsquo;ll have a better and easier chance accessing this whole thing from the software site eased my decision making.
but unfortenatly lacking the community around me being numped by the job was one of many reasons why I didn&rsquo;t develop in that period unitl the pandamic came in 2020 where I was layed off on May exactly five years from when I started, getting layed off kicked off my passion again and with it the regret of not making a move earlier, but without a way in to the field or the community I thought the best way to get in was to make a Master&rsquo;s on Software Engineering. and indeed that was the case as I&rsquo;ve started that journy on 2021 and made some really good friends along the way, but till that time what was eating me up is the fact that I&rsquo;ve yet to land a job in this field and as it turns out, without any project with your name on it, it&rsquo;s really hard to even get an interview, but I never stopped applying untill at the end of the Masters I&rsquo;ve found a job with one of the biggest transportation logistics companies in Sudan called Raiba as an Applicaiton Engineer &ldquo;implementing and supporting the Microsoft Dynamic Business Central System&rdquo;, I was thrilled at first thinking that &ldquo;FINALLY&rdquo; my way into the new career has just started, but one month in and I could already tell that there is no real development for me in it at all, as it turns out, most of what I was wanted for was the &ldquo;Support&rdquo; part and boi I did not switch career for that, I wanted a challenge, a real challenge.
I started applying immediatly and luckly I&rsquo;ve found me an internship in a software company called &ldquo;Maxnet&rdquo; with a promise of being an elite software solution team I took that risk and quitted my job from Raiba, and this was the actual beginning of my career shift.</p>
